Beautiful Interactive Neural Nets running locally on ESP32s.

This idea was born out my realization that much of modern discourse around improving model performance is adding more parameters. In the era of LLMs, models with millions of parameters are deemed obsolete in favor of billion- and even trillion-parameter models. Even in vision, with the advent of billion-parameter Vision Transformers that human performance at many classic image tasks - it made me wonder - how *small* can we make an effective model? And how can we present this model in a compelling, beautiful way? This project is a foray into those questions.
